# StormReports News App

Welcome to StormReports, a React-based news application that allows you to explore the latest news articles based on different categories.


## Overview

StormReports is a simple news application that fetches news articles from the [NewsData API](https://newsdata.io/) and displays them in various categories. The application is built using React.

## Components

### NewsItem Component

The `NewsItem` component is responsible for rendering individual news items. It displays the title, description, and an image if available. Users can click on the "Read More" button to view the full article.

### NewsBoard Component

The `NewsBoard` component is the main component that fetches news articles based on the selected category. It utilizes the `NewsItem` component to display a list of news articles.

### Navbar Component

The `Navbar` component provides navigation options for different news categories. Clicking on a category updates the news displayed in the `NewsBoard` component.
